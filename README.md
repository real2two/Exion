# Exion

A private chat platform. 

**No, I do not give support on how to use/install Exion.**

Keep in mind this won't be updated as much, and the code quality is terrible. There's also a bunch of bugs I probably won't fix.

This project was made for fun, and I've learnt a lot of bad programming practices I have done, and how I could improve it. (but I was too lazy to)

__**PROGRAMMING TIP TO ANYONE WHO TRIES TO MAKE A CHAT APP IN THE FUTURE**: DON'T USE KEYV. JUST LEARN MYSQL OR SOMETHING. IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO EVERYTHING THEN.__
