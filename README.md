# Exion

A private chat platform. 

**No, I do not give support on how to use/install Exion.**

Keep in mind this won't be updated as much, and the code quality is terrible. There's also a bunch of bugs I probably won't fix.

This project was made for fun, and I've learnt a lot of bad programming practices I have done, and how I could improve it. (but I was too lazy to)
